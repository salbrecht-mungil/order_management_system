## Time spend on solution

The initial planning of the project including looking up a couple of things took about 45 min.

Writing the code for the solution including all comments took approx 2 hours.


## Ideas for improvements
- Write tests in a separate file including test cases for Exceptions being raised when invalid inputs, e.g. creation_timestamp < 0
- Considering to not mutate the list of objects when updating the status
- There might be a more elegant solution to handle the delivery_time
- Not sure whether a list of order objects is the best performing data structure - would need to investigate 
- Use class for Orders instead of using a list of dictionaries
